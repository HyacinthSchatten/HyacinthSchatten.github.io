<h2>Statement</h2>
<p>I elaborate this website as a quasi academic page.</p>

<h3>Sinobiopolitics</h3>
<p>Two events push the biopolitics-in-china into the margin: Covid-19 cordon sanitaire and the precipitous youth marriage and birth rates. The discourses of Foucault and Agamben do not coincide with the phenomena, and we must address the "far-eastern" nature of life (from-zoe-to-bios) management.</p>

<p>Some Chinese scholars defend a "constructive" politics of life, hoping to make the sovereign appear humane and ethically concerned. Without discussing positions and intentions, their arguments are far from admissible nor consistent. A basic proposal covers these themes: the worldview of Tian Xia, natural law and Li, Sino-logos, and the post-Qing episteme.</p>
