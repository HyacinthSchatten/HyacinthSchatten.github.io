<p>[Self-Introduction] Hyacinth here. I am testing the functionality of github pages. If permissible, I will elaborate the app for a quasi academic page</p>



<h2>Statement</h2>
<p>I elaborate this website as a quasi academic page.</p>

<h3>Sinobiopolitics</h3>

<p>Two events push the biopolitics-in-china into the margin: Covid-19 cordon sanitaire and the precipitous youth marriage and birth rates (some may concern more about the ethnic issues, which is not in the scope of this project). The discourses of Foucault and Agamben do not coincide with the phenomena, and we must address the "far-eastern" nature of life (from-zoe-to-bios) management.</p>

<p>Some Chinese scholars defend a "constructive" politics of life, hoping to make the sovereign appear humane and ethically concerned. Without discussing positions and intentions, their arguments are far from admissible nor consistent. A corrective proposal covers these themes: the worldview of Tian Xia, natural law and Li, Sino-logos, and the post-Qing episteme.</p>



<h3>Dynamical Semantics for AIKBs</h3>

<p>Increasingly, scholars are concerned with applying logical techniques (considered to be a feature of early AI research) to the data-driven paradigm. The current research is still rudimentary and serves as an auxiliary solution to improve performance on datasets. It is clear that this is just the application of symbolic methods to neural models.</p>

<p>There is a well-recognized theme in cognitive science that human use of knowledge integrates it into consciousness as well as intuition, the so-called internalization. Philosophical research argues that we therefore need a dynamic semantics that can merge new knowledge into the original understanding, i.e., knowledge-oriented learning.</p>
    
<p>Combining dynamical KBs and AI, the current technology is rudimentary and it is fraught with challenges and has three difficulties: tractability, flexibility and ground truth. our interest does not concern the third aspect. Rather, we explore how to build a semantic theory of AI.</p>
